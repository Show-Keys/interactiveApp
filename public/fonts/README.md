Place your licensed font files here so the app can load them at runtime.

Expected filenames (you can adjust in src/index.css):
- /fonts/ge-ss.woff2 (Arabic)
- /fonts/ge-ss.ttf
- /fonts/century-gothic.woff2 (English)
- /fonts/century-gothic.ttf

Notes:
- These font files are not included in the repo.
- Ensure you have the proper license to embed/distribute them.
